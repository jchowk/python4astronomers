Astropy I: core functions
=========================

`Astropy <http://www.astropy.org>`_ is a community-developed core Python
package for Astronomy (with the term used in the broad sense, from Solar
System work to Cosmology). The first public release (v0.2) took place on
February 20th 2013, bug-fixes are released a regular intervals.

Installation instructions for the most current version and the full
documentation can be found on `www.astropy.org <http://www.astropy.org>`_.

After this workshop you will be familiar with some parts of Astropy, a
second workshop will cover the remaining functionality. 

Beginners in Python should be able to follow, but please ensure that you have
a functional Python distribution installed prior to the workshop.

the content, either by clicking on the link or by executing this
python code::

    from urllib import request
    import tarfile
    url = 'http://python4astronomers.github.io/_downloads/astropy_examples.tar'
    tarfile.open(fileobj=request.urlopen(url), mode='r|').extractall()
    cd data
    ls

Then start up IPython with the ``--matplotlib`` option to enable interactive
